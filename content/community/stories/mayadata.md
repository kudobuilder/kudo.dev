Custom process flows that can execute commands and make calls to Kubernetes APIs combined with an operator repository unifies the best parts of application lifecycle management tools out in the ecosystem we were looking for our production environment. As contributor and maintainer of the OpenEBS project, we are also excited to join the list of operators with the upcoming release of OpenEBS KUDO operator.  KUDO will support OpenEBS community's need to simplify day 2 operations for stateful applications as well as storage in Kubernetes.
