# How to host an Operator in a local repository

This runbook explains how to host an operator repository on your local system.

## Preconditions

* You have built an operator package in `~/repo`.  Follow [create kudo package](create-kudo-package) for an example.
* You have python 3 installed (used for http server)
* KUDO is running on a Kubernetes cluster

## Steps

### Build Local Index File

`kubectl kudo repo index ~/repo`

### Run Repository HTTP Server

```bash
cd ~/repo
python -m http.server 80
```

### Add the local repository to KUDO client

`kubectl kudo repo add local http://localhost`

### Set the local repository to default KUDO context

`kubectl kudo repo context local`

### Confirm KUDO context

```bash
$ kubectl kudo repo list
NAME     	URL
community	https://kudo-repository.storage.googleapis.com/0.10.0
*local   	http://localhost
```

::: tip Note
The `*` next to local indicates that it is the default context for the KUDO client.
:::

### Verify you are using the local repository for an installation

Using the verbose CLI output flag (`-v`) with KUDO it is possible to trace from where an operator is being installed from.

`kubectl kudo install first-operator -v 9`

The output should look like:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo install first-operator -v 9
repo configs: { name:community, url:https://kudo-repository.storage.googleapis.com/0.10.0 },{ name:local, url:http://localhost }

repository used { name:local, url:http://localhost }
configuration from "/Users/kensipe/.kube/config" finds host https://127.0.0.1:32768

You will also see in the terminal running python http.server the following:

```bash
127.0.0.1 - - [14/Jan/2020 07:59:24] "GET /index.yaml HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [14/Jan/2020 07:59:24] "GET /first-operator-0.2.0.tgz HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
