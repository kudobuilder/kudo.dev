# KUDO Compared to Other Tools

Deploying software to Kubernetes comes in a wide variety of forms, and knowing which is appropriate for your use case is important for long term success. In this section, we compare KUDO to a variety of different deployment paradigms:

[Static Definition Formats](/docs/comparison/static-yaml.html) approaches deployment in it's most simple form - templated and untemplated YAML manifests, and evaluates tools in this space.

[Infrastructure as Code](/docs/comparison/infrastructure-as-code.html) explores the use of traditional IaC tooling, such as Ansible and Terraform, for Kubernetes application deployments.

[Custom Controllers](/docs/comparison/custom-controllers.html) walks through SDKs and API clients used to build Kubernetes controllers directly.

[High Level Controllers](/docs/comparison/high-level-controllers.html) compares KUDO to similar tooling in it's space, and explores the difference between these tools and declarative operator development.
