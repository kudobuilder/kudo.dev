## Setup the KUDO Kubectl Plugin

### Requirements

- `kubectl` version `1.13.0` or newer

### Installation

You can either download CLI binaries for linux or MacOS from our [release page](https://github.com/kudobuilder/kudo/releases), or install the CLI plugin using `brew`:

```bash
brew tap kudobuilder/tap
brew install kudo-cli
```

or you can compile and install the plugin from your `$GOPATH/src/github.com/kudobuilder/kudo` root folder via:

```bash
make cli-install
```

Another alternative is `krew` the package manager for kubectl plugins [doc](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew)

```bash
kubectl krew install kudo
```

The file path to KUDO configuration folder. (default: "$HOME/.kudo")
:::

::: flag --instance (string)
The instance name. (default: Operator name)
:::

::: flag --kubeconfig (string)
The file path to Kubernetes configuration file. (default: "$HOME/.kube/config")
:::

::: flag --namespace (string)
The namespace used for the operator installation. (default: "default")
:::

::: flag --operator-version (string)
A specific operator version on the official GitHub repo. (default to the most recent)
:::

::: flag --app-version (string)

:::

::: flag -P, --parameter-file (stringArray)
Path to a YAML file with parameter values. The top-level element in this file must be a mapping,
where keys are parameter names and values are the parameter values.

See [the section on installing with overrides](#install-a-package-overriding-instance-name-and-parameters) below
for an example of a parameter value file.

This is useful if you want to keep your instances' parameter values in version control,
or for specifying particularly complex or long parameter values which are inconvenient
to handle in shell command line.

Parameters are collected by first reading the files specified with `--parameter-file`/`-P` (in the order specified)
and then from values specified with `--parameter`/`-p`. Last encountered value of a given parameter wins.
This lets you define defaults in one or more files, and override them on the command line as needed.
:::

::: flag --repo (string)
The name of the repository in the `repo list` configuration to use. (default to configured repository context)
:::


## Examples

### KUDO Init

KUDO itself is a Kubernetes operator. As such it requires the installation of CRDs and the deployment of KUDO, in addition to the establishment of certain prerequisites like creating the namespace to install in. All of this can be handled by the KUDO CLI. To accomplish this, run `kubectl kudo init`.  Some variations on this might include:

* `kubectl kudo init --wait --wait-timeout 600` which will install CRDS, install KUDO and will wait up to 600 seconds for KUDO to be responsive.
* `kubectl kudo init --dry-run --output=yaml > kudo-install.yaml` which will not install anything but will output YAML to a file which can be applied manually to the server.
* `kubectl kudo init --version=0.10.0` which will install the `0.10.0` version in the cluster using the `kudobuilder/controller:v0.10.0` image
* `kubectl kudo init --kudo-image=mycompany/controller:v0.6.0` allowing for user certified images or air-gapped alternative images to be installed.
* `kubectl kudo init --client-only` which will not apply any changes to the cluster. It will setup the default KUDO home with repository options.
* `kubectl kudo init --crd-only` will create crds in the cluster.

**Note**: Looking to delete kubernetes objects created via init, run:

* `kubectl kudo init --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl delete -f -` which will delete all kubernetes objects created with init or
* `kubectl kudo init --dry-run -o yaml --crd-only | kubectl delete -f -` which will only delete the KUDO CRDs.

**Note**: If you want to ensure all components are installed, just init again. It will cycle through all objects and ensure they are created.

### Install a Package

There are four options how to install a package. For development you can install packages from your local filesystem or local tgz file.
For testing, or working without a repository, it is possible to install from a URL. Another option is to install from the package repository.

Installation during development can use a relative or absolute path to the package folder.

```bash
kubectl kudo install pkg/kudoctl/bundle/testdata/zk
```

To support the installation of operators not yet in the repository, it is possible to install directly from a URL.

```bash
kubectl kudo install http://kudo.dev/zk.tgz
```

For normal operations it is recommended to use the official packages provided through the [kudobuilder/operators](https://github.com/kudobuilder/operators) repository.
To install official Kafka package you have to do the following:

```bash
kubectl kudo install kafka
```

Both of these options will install new instance of that operator into your cluster. By default, the instance name will be generated.

```bash
kubectl kudo install kafka --app-version=2.4.0
```

This will install new instance of Kafka Operator which maps to Kafka app version 2.4.0

```bash
kubectl kudo install kafka --operator-version=1.2.0
```

This will install new instance of Kafka Operator which maps to Kafka operator version 1.2.0

### Install a Package Overriding Instance Name and Parameters

Use `--instance` for setting an instance name.
Use `--parameter`/`-p` and/or `--parameter-file`/`-P` for setting parameters.

For example:

```bash
$ cat kafka-parameters.yaml
ZOOKEEPER_URI: zk-zk-0.zk-hs:2181,zk-zk-1.zk-hs:2181,zk-zk-2.zk-hs:2181
ZOOKEEPER_PATH: /small
$ kubectl kudo install kafka --instance=my-kafka-name -p BROKER_COUNT=3 -P kafka-parameters.yaml
operator.kudo.dev/kafka unchanged
operatorversion.kudo.dev/kafka unchanged
instance.kudo.dev/v1alpha1/my-kafka-name created
$ kubectl get instances
NAME            AGE
my-kafka-name   6s
```


### Get Instances

You can use the `get` command to get a list of all current instances:

```bash
kubectl kudo get instances --namespace=<default> --kubeconfig=<$HOME/.kube/config>
```

Example:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo get instances
  List of current instances in namespace "default":
  .
  ├── small
  ├── up
  └── zk
```

This maps to the `kubectl` command:

`kubectl get instances`

Example:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo get instances
  NAME      CREATED AT
  small     4d
  up        3d
  zk        4d
```

### Get the Status of an Instance

Now that you have a list of available instances, you can get the current status of all plans for one of them:

`kubectl kudo plan status --instance=<instanceName> --kubeconfig=<$HOME/.kube/config>`

**Note**: The `--instance` flag is mandatory.

```bash
$ kubectl kudo plan status --instance=up
  Plan(s) for "up" in namespace "default":
  .
  └── up (Operator-Version: "upgrade-v1" Active-Plan: "up-deploy-493146000")
      ├── Plan deploy (serial strategy) [COMPLETE]
      │   └── Phase par (serial strategy) [COMPLETE]
      │       └── Step run-step (COMPLETE)
      ├── Plan update (serial strategy) [NOT ACTIVE]
      │   └── Phase par (serial strategy) [NOT ACTIVE]
      │       └── Step par (serial strategy) [NOT ACTIVE]
      │           └── run-step [NOT ACTIVE]
      └── Plan upgrade (serial strategy) [NOT ACTIVE]
          └── Phase par (serial strategy) [NOT ACTIVE]
              └── Step par (serial strategy) [NOT ACTIVE]
                  └── run-step [NOT ACTIVE]
```

In this tree chart you see all important information in one screen:

* `up` is the instance you specified.
* `default` is the namespace you are in.
* `upgrade-v1` is the instance's **Operator-Version**.
* `up-deploy-493146000` is the current **Active-Plan**.
    + `par` is a serial phase within the `deploy` plan which is `COMPLETE`.
    + `deploy` is a `serial` plan which is `COMPLETE`.
    + `run-step` is a `serial` step which is `COMPLETE`.
* `update` is another `serial` plan that is currently `NOT ACTIVE`.
    + `par` is a serial phase within the `update` plan which is `NOT ACTIVE`.
    + `par` is a `serial` collection of steps which is `NOT ACTIVE`.
    + `run-step` is a `serial` step within the `par` step collection which is `NOT ACTIVE`.
* `upgrade` is another `serial` plan which is currently `NOT ACTIVE`.
    + `par` is a serial phase within the `upgrade` plan which is `NOT ACTIVE`
    + `par` is a `serial` collection of steps which is `NOT ACTIVE`.
    + `run-step` is a `serial` step within the `par` step collection which is `NOT ACTIVE`.

For comparison, the according `kubectl` commands to retrieve the above information are:

* `kubectl get instances` (to get the matching `OperatorVersion`)
* `kubectl describe operatorversion upgrade-v1`

Here, you can find the overview of all available plans in `Spec.Plans` of the matching `OperatorVersion`:

```bash
$ kubectl describe operatorversion upgrade-v1

### Delete an Instance

You can delete an instance (i.e. uninstall it from the cluster) using `kubectl kudo uninstall --instance <instanceName>`. The deletion of an instance triggers the removal of all the objects owned by it.

### Get the History of Plan Executions

This is helpful if you want to find out which plan ran on your instance to a particular `OperatorVersion`.
Run this command to retrieve all plans that ran for the instance `up` and its OperatorVersion `upgrade-v1`:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo plan history upgrade-v1 --instance=up
  History of plan-executions for "up" in namespace "default" to operator-version "upgrade-v1":
  .
  └── up-deploy-493146000 (created 4h56m12s ago)
```

Run this command to retrieve the history of all plans applied to an instance:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo plan history --instance=up
  History of all plan-executions for "up" in namespace "default":
  .
  └── up-deploy-493146000 (created 4h52m34s ago)
```

This includes the previous history but also all OperatorVersions that have been applied to the selected instance.

### Package an Operator

You can use the `package create` command to package an operator into a tarball. The package name will be determined by the operator metadata in the package files. The folder of the operator is passed as an argument. It is possible to pass a `--destination` location to build the tgz file into.

`kubectl kudo package create zookeeper --destination=target`

Example:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo package create ../operators/repository/zookeeper/operator/ --destination=~
  Package created: /Users/kensipe/zookeeper-0.1.0.tgz
```

### Validating an Operator

You can use the `package verify` command to check the condition of an operator which returns warnings and errors.  Warnings are conditions such as a parameter is defined in the params.yaml but is not used a template file.  Errors are conditions such as a parameter is used in a template file but is not defined in the params.yaml.  If there are errors the command exits with a non-zero exit code.

Examples:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo package verify ../operators/repository/zookeeper/operator/
  package is valid
```

```bash
$ kubectl kudo package verify ../operators/repository/kafka/operator/
Warnings
parameter "SSL_ENDPOINT_IDENTIFICATION_ENABLED" defined but not used.
parameter "CUSTOM_SERVER_PROPERTIES" defined but not used.
package is valid
```

### Creating a Repository Index File

A repository is a set of operator packages (tarballs) which are indexed in an index file. To create an index file, execute `kubectl kudo repo index operators` where `operators` is a folder container operator package files.

```bash
# example folder
ls ~/repo
kafka-2.2.1-0.1.2.tgz		kafka-0.2.0.tgz

# repo index
kubectl kudo repo index ~/repo
index /Users/kensipe/repo/index.yaml created.

cat ~/repo/index.yaml
apiVersion: v1
entries:
  kafka:
  - digest: f81ffdad2caea40c8fc19c676b1e51b598d1472de5563c0ae8308e649c8ea159
    maintainers:
    - name: Zain Malik <zmalikshxil@gmail.com>
    name: kafka
    operatorVersion: 0.2.0
    urls:
    - http://localhost/kafka-0.2.0.tgz
  - appVersion: 2.2.1
    digest: fbff9679cd0070bf10dcafc8d5e1e7d13a5c1651154165162c543508895a37c0
    maintainers:
    - name: Zain Malik <zmalikshxil@gmail.com>
    name: kafka
    operatorVersion: 0.1.2
    urls:
    - http://localhost/kafka-2.2.1-0.1.2.tgz
```

It can be useful when overwriting a file to use `--overwrite`.  It is also useful to use `--url=http://kudo.dev/repo` to supply the desired URL the operator packages will be hosted on.

### Managing Repositories

After KUDO has initialized a client, `kubectl kudo init` or `kubectl kudo init --client-only`, it is possible to configure other repositories. Let's start with a `repo list` using:

```text
kubectl kudo repo list
NAME      	URL
*community	https://kudo-repository.storage.googleapis.com
```
The default installation shown shows one repository configured with the name "community".  The `*` indicates that this is the default repository to use (unless the flag `--repo=xyz` is used).  This is considered the current context.

When a repository is added using `kudo add ...`, the url provided will be used to access the index.yaml file which will be validated.  If the url is not reachable or the index file is corrupt the repository entry will fail to be added.  It is possible to skip this check with the `--skip-check` flag.  You can add a repository in the following way.  `kubectl kudo repo add local http://localhost --skip-check`. Resulting in:

```text
kubectl kudo repo list
NAME        URL
*community	https://kudo-repository.storage.googleapis.com
local       http://localhost
```

In order to set the local repository as the current context execute: `kubectl kudo repo context local`, resulting in:

```text
kubectl kudo repo list
NAME      URL
community	https://kudo-repository.storage.googleapis.com
*local    http://localhost
```

Now all installs and upgrades will default to the local repository.

In order to remove a repository simply run `kubectl kudo repo remove foo`


### Update Parameters on Running Operator Instance

Every operator can define overridable parameters in `params.yaml`. When installing an operator and deploying an instance, you can use the defaults or override them with `-p` or `-P` parameters to `kudo install`.

The `kudo update` command allows you to change these parameters even on an already running operator instance. For example, if you have an instance in your cluster named `dev-flink` (you can figure out what you have installed with `kubectl get instances`) and that operator exposes a parameter with the name `param`, you can change its value with the following command:

`kubectl kudo update --instance dev-flink -p param=value`

### Upgrade Running Operator from One Version to Another

Following the same example from the previous section, having a `dev-flink` instance installed, we can upgrade it to a newer version with the following command:

`kubectl kudo upgrade flink --instance dev-flink -p param=xxx`

A new version of that operator is installed to the cluster and `upgrade` (or `deploy`) plan is started to roll out new Flink pods.

At the same time, we're overriding the value of the parameter `param`. That is optional and you can always do it in a separate step via `kudo update`.
