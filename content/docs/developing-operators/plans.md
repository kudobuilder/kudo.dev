# Plans

## Overview

Plans capture the individual steps of operational tasks. A plan organizes these tasks into `phases` and `steps`. Each step references the [tasks](tasks.md) to run for this step. By organizing steps into phases, complex behavior of services can be captured.

Plans and phases have a `strategy`. The `strategy` indicates if `phases` and `steps` should run in parallel or in serial.

```yaml
...
tasks:
  - name: deploy-master
    kind: Apply
    spec:
      resources:
        - master-service.yaml
        - master.yaml
  - name: deploy-agent
    kind: Apply
    spec:
      resources:
        - agent-service.yaml
        - agent.yaml
plans:
  deploy:
    strategy: parallel
    phases:
      - name: deploy-master
        strategy: serial
        steps:
          - name: deploy-master
            tasks:
              - deploy-master
      - name: deploy-agent
        strategy: serial
        steps:
          - name: deploy-agent
            tasks:
              - deploy-agent
```

The KUDO controller deploys the plans of an operator. Only a single plan can be in active deployment at a time. KUDO has different approaches to decide which plan to deploy.

## Deploy and update plans

By default, KUDO will start the `deploy` plan if no other plan has been deployed yet. In case of an instance update, KUDO will start a `upgrade` or `update` plan if it exists. If none of these plans exist, KUDO will start the `deploy` plan.

In the example below, the `deploy` plan creates a service defined in `service.yaml`. In case of an update, the service's cache needs to be updated. The `update-cache.yaml` provides the necessary resources to do that and thus is part of the `update` plan.

```yaml
...
tasks:
  - name: app
    kind: Apply
    spec:
      resources:
        - service.yaml
  - name: update
    kind: Apply
    spec:
      resources:
        - service.yaml
        - update-cache.yaml
plans:
  deploy:
    strategy: serial
    phases:
      - name: deploy-service
        strategy: serial
        steps:
          - name: deploy
            tasks:
              - app
  update:
    strategy: serial
    phases:
      - name: update-service
        strategy: serial
        steps:
          - name: update
            tasks:
              - update
```

## Cleanup plans

If an optional `cleanup` plan is part of an operator, this plan will run as part of the deletion of an [Instance](../what-is-kudo.md#main-concepts). Once this plan completes or fails, the instance will be deleted.
Operator developers should take care that there aren't any triggers defined for this plan. Furthermore it should be expected that the steps of this plan could fail. E.g., users may want to delete an instance because its `deploy` plan is stuck. In that case resources that the `cleanup` plan tries to remove might not exist on the cluster. The `cleanup` plan will start even if other plans are in progress.

```yaml
...
tasks:
  - name: database
    kind: Apply
    spec:
      resources:
        - database.yaml
  - name: cleanup
    kind: Apply
    spec:
      resources:
        - remove-database.yaml
spec:
  plans:
    deploy:
      strategy: serial
      phases:
        - name: deploy-database
          strategy: serial
          steps:
            - name: deploy
              tasks:
                - database
    cleanup:
      strategy: serial
      phases:
        - name: cleanup-databse
          strategy: serial
          steps:
            - name: cleanup
              tasks:
                - cleanup
```

The `cleanup` plan is implemented using [finalizers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#finalizers). The instance's `metadata.finalizers` contains the value "kudo.dev.instance.cleanup" while the `cleanup` plan is in progress.

## Parameter triggers

[Parameters](parameters.md) can have optional triggers. A trigger references a plan that will run if the parameter is updated.

The operations required to update a running application can vary depending on which parameter is
being updated. For instance updating the `BROKER_COUNT`, may require a simple update of the deployment, whereas
updating the `APPLICATION_MEMORY` may require rolling out a new version via a canary or blue/green deployment.

```yaml
...
parameters:
- name: REPLICAS
  trigger: deploy
- name: APPLICATION_MEMORY
  trigger: canary
```

## Executing Plans

In general, KUDO manager will automatically [execute a plan](../what-is-kudo.md#operator-parameters) when the corresponding parameter changes. However, sometimes this is not enough. Sometimes you need to trigger a plan manually, e.g. to create a periodic `backup`, or `restore` data in case of data corruption. Such plans typically do not need a corresponding parameter. KUDO [v0.11.0](https://github.com/kudobuilder/kudo/releases/tag/v0.11.0) introduced new feature: manual plan execution. In a nutshell, you can now:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo plan trigger --name deploy --instance my-instance
```

which will trigger the `deploy` plan and execute it on `my-instance`. While this looks relatively easy on the surface, the devil is in detail, so let's take a closer look.

### Plan Life Cycle

Having the ability to trigger multiple plans on demand raises the question: what happens if two plans run concurrently? The answer is: it depends. Should two plans be completely independent of each other (e.g. `deploy` deploys the services and `monitor` deploys the monitoring pods) both can be executed in parallel. But if two plans in question are `backup` and `restore` or `deploy` and `migrate`? Some plans are incompatible with others. A few may not even be reentrant. While it is probably ok to restart a running `deploy` plan, a `restore` plan might not be reentrant because of possible data corruption.

We're planning to explore the realm of plan compatibility further in the future. Annotating plan affinity and anti-affinity, reentrant vs non-reentrant plans, plan cancellation and transient plan parameters are some of the topics we're examining. All contributions and feedback are highly welcome.

Having all this in mind how can we ensure correct plan execution? Meet Kubernetes admission controllers.

### Admission Controllers

In a nutshell, Kubernetes admission controllers are plugins that govern and enforce how the cluster is used. They can be thought of as a gatekeeper that intercepts (authenticated) API requests and may change the request object or deny the request altogether. Kubernetes already comes with a bunch of these [pre-installed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/) which govern everything from user authorization to the namespace life cycle.

KUDO manager employs an Instance admission controller that governs changes to Instances, making sure that plans do not interfere. Schematically this looks like the following:
![Instance update](/images/admission-instance-update.png)

Instance admission controller governs any update to the Instance either through manual plan execution or Instance parameter updates. The general rule of thumb is the following: all plans should be terminal (either successfully with status `COMPLETE` or unsuccessfully with `FATAL_ERROR`) before a new plan is allowed to start. A singular plan can be restarted so we assume all plans to be reentrant at least for now. While this might not be true for all plans, we think that it covers the 80/20 case e.g. when a `deploy` plan is stuck and must be restarted with less memory per node. In case a request is rejected, the Instance controller returns an error explaining why exactly the update was denied.

The admission controller would also reject parameter updates that would trigger multiple distinct plans. There are a few exceptions too: for example, a `cleanup` plan is special and is executed when an Instance is deleted. `cleanup` can not be triggered manually and is allowed to override any existing plan (since the Instance is being deleted anyway).

As of KUDO v0.11.0, the Instance admission controller is optional though we're planing to make it mandatory in the near future. See [kudo init](../cli.md#kudo-init) documentation for more details.
